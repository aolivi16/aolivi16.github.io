        <p> This website is intended to teach people all about crayfish, 
            also known as crawfish, and show everyone that these little creatures make great pets. 
            I owned a pet crayfish for over 6 years and enjoyed every minute of it!
            And I hope that this website will reach people interested in having an uncommon pet. 
            Whether you are just browsing the website for fun, or looking to purchase your own underwater friend,
            I hope this website will be able to teach you all about the simple and wonderful crayfish. <i>Follow the links above to learn more!</i>
