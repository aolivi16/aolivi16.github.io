        <ul> 
        <li> Crayfish are not active during the day, don't worry if you don't see them out!</li>
        <li> Their care needs are different then cats and dogs but no less time consuming. </li>
        <li> They need enrichment like any other animal! No boring tanks!</li>
        <li> Like any pet, owning crayfish can be incredibly rewarding as long as you are prepared to give them the care they need. </li>
        </ul>
